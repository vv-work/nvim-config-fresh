```c_sharp
public class Example
{
    public int x = 10;
    public int y = 20;

    public void PrintSum()
    {
    // This is a comment
        for (int i = 0; i < x; i++)
    {
    // This is a comm
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
    // This is a comment
}
```

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)
